# Blackjack Project

### Overview
An interactive program to play blackjack card game against the computer. The program incorporates the basic ruleset of the blackjack and consists of a class structure that mimics a deck of cards. Card and deck implementations are not coupled with blackjack, and can be reused to implement another game such as poker or bridge.

### Technologies Used
- Java
- OOP
- Encapsulation
- Abstract Classes
- Interfaces
- Enums

### How to Run
Run the program and interact with the menu options to access all functions of the application.

### Lessons Learned
Creating the game logic from scratch has enabled me to organize my thoughts into code. Another key learning point was using Enums and creating classes that are not coupled with the app. This kind of logic can indeed be useful in many other applications.
